title:  'Agent-Driven, Game-Based Learning: Personalized CS Education for Diverse Students'
description: Personalized education agents can be designed to improve students’ learning outcomes by identifying their strengths, weaknesses, personalities, and generating content to address their needs. Deployed in an educational version of Minecraft to teach computational and interdisciplinary thinking, agents connect concepts from lessons to “big picture” thinking by creating connections between STEM topics and interdisciplinary topics, such as the Language Arts. Agents will translate student progression and learning outcomes to teachers for their assessment of student progress.
