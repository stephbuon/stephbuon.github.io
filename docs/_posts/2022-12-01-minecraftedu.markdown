title:  'Agent-Driven, Game-Based Learning: Personalized CS Education for Diverse Students'
description: AI agents can personalize education by identifying studentsâ€™ strengths, weaknesses, and personalities to generate content tailored to them. This work presents "personalized education agents" deployed in an educational version of Minecraft. Agents bridge concepts from lessons to "big picture" thinking by creating connections between STEM and interdisciplinary topics, such as the Language Arts. Agents translate student progression and learning outcomes to teachers for their assessment of student progress.
