title:  'Personalized Agents'
description: Preliminary work on the development of personalized education agents deployed in a version Minecraft designed to teach computational and interdisciplinary thinking. Agents will autonomously identify student progression and generate customized curriculum based on students' existing knowledge, personalities, and interests. Agents will connect concepts to the "bigger picture" by creating connections between STEM topics and interdisciplinary topics, such as the Language Arts. Agents will translate student progression and learning outcomes to teachers for their assessment of student progress.
