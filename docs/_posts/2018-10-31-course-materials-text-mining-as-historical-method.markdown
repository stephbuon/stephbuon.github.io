### About this Course

Computer-powered methods are changing the way that we access information about society. New methods help us to detect change over time, to identify influential figures, and to name turning points. What happens when we apply these tools to a million congressional debates or tweets?  

I designed and collaborated on a series of Jupyter Notebooks for Jo Gulid's class, "Text Mining as Historical Method," to explore questions like these. The Notebooks for this class provide an introduction to the cutting-edge methodologies of textual analysis that are transforming the humanities. They are geared towards both computationalists as well as those with a background in the humanities (but not code) and are designed to teach the skills of analyzing texts as data for evidence of change over time. 

This post provides an overview of the material used by "Text Mining as Historical Method." For full course materials, including interactive Jupyter Notebooks used by the class, see the [digital-history](https://github.com/stephbuon/digital-history) repository.
