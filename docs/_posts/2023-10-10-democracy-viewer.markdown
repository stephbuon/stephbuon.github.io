description: Democracy Viewer is an open-source text mining application that enables analysts to explore and interpret humanities texts using techniques like word counts, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. It supports both distant and close reading. Analysts can upload their own datasets or work with curated collections available on the platform. Democracy Viewer also provides access to open government data, including U.S. Congressional records, making public texts more accessible for research and civic engagement.
