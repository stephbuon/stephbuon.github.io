title:  'The Human Tafficking Project'
description: Human trafficking is a critical human rights issue. The challenges behind identifying and connecting each person, location, and event described by text-based media (e.g. reports, online posts, transcripts) can hinder our ability to understand this issue. This work presents a methodology that leverages "human computation gaming" to crowdsource annotations and improve a language model's predictions for identifying named entites.
