title: 'PANGeA'
description: PANGeA is a method that utilizes large language models (LLMs) guided by a game designer's criteria to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing games (RPGs). It procedurally generates narrative including non-playable characters NPCs that exhibit traits from the Big 5 Personality Model. Notably, PANGeA facilitates free-form, dynamic interactions between players and the environment in line with the game's generated narrative. To prevent free-form text input from causing the LLM generated responses to deviate from the narrative, PANGeA employs a validation system that aligns responses with the evolving story. This system is supported by a server with a custom memory system that provides context for generated responses. The server's REST interface allows for easy integration with any game engine and LLM interface.
