title: 'PANGeA'
description: PANGeA is a method that uses large language models (LLMs) to create narrative content for turn-based RPGs based on game designers' high-level criteria. It introduces a novel validation system for handling free-form text input during development and gameplay, employing "self-reflection" techniques. It enriches player-NPC interactions by generating personality-biased non-playable characters (NPCs) that exhibit traits from the Big 5 Personality Model. This system is supported by a server with a custom memory system (see "gaia") that provides context for generated responses. The server's REST interface allows for integration with any game engine and LLM interface.

Under Review.

Video games provide interactive storytelling mechanisms that allow players to engage directly with the environment, transforming them into active participants of the game narrative. While early research on procedural narrative generation primarily focused on creating coherent sequences of events, this approach alone may fail to produce an engaging narrative that dynamically responds to the player's choices in-game. 

Given this challenge, this research introduces PANGeA--standing for **P**rocedural **A**rtificial **N**arrative using **Ge**nerative **A**I. PANGeA is a structured approach to narrative generation that uses large language models (LLMs) for the design and creation of interactive narratives in turn-based, role playing video games (RPGs). A game designer must inject high-level narrative criteria into PANGeA's prompt schema, which are parsed by a server-aided, game engine plug-in and provided as instruction for a LLM to generate playable narrative assets. These assets include (but are not limited to) landscape settings, key items, events, and "personality-biased" non-playable characters (NPC) capable of free-formed dialogue with the player. NPC-agents are â€œpersonality-biased," meaning they are instructed to express Big 5 personality traits when generating responses to social stimuli. In this way, NPCs respond in diverse ways based on their unique personas.

As generative AI gains popularity in the profession of video game design, frameworks that promote consistency in narrative generation and guard against innocuous player input derailing or breaking the game will become essential for fostering active participation between the player and the environment. PANGeA responds to this need by using techniques based on "self reflection" to evaluate and respond to free-form interactions between the player and the environment during game play.

For its broad application, the PANGeA's server has a REST interface, allowing any game engine to directly integrate with PANGeA. Three key components of the server include: an LLM interface, a custom memory system, and a novel validation system.
