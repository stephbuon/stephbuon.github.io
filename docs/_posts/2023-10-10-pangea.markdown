title: 'PANGeA'
description: PANGeA is a method that utilizes large language models (LLMs) guided by a game designer's criteria to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing games (RPGs). PANGeA not only generates game data such as settings, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs) but also facilitates free-form, dynamic interactions between players and the environment in line with the game's precedurally generated narrative. The NPCs exhibit traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their responses. To prevent LLM responses from deviating from the game narrative due to free-form text input, PANGeA employs a validation system that aligns responses with the evolving story. This system is supported by a server with a custom memory system that provides context for generated responses. The server's REST interface allows for easy integration with any game engine and LLM interface.
