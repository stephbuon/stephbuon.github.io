title:  'Contributions to the rOpengov Universe'
description: Open government data enables citizens to see government activities and decision-making processes, empowering them to participate more fully in the democratic process. Researchers can use open government data for studies and projects, generating insights and contributing to evidence-based policy-making. To this end, this work introduces R packages hosted by the rOpengov Universe that are designed to make analyzing contemporary and historical open government data more accessible. Queried data is returned in a clean and analysis-ready dataframe.
