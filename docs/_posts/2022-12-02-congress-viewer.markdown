Our prototype web app, the <a href="https://shinyviz.smu.edu/shiny/public/congress-viewer-demo/" style="color: blue"> Congress Viewer </a>, explores how the tools to measure lexical change -- and more sophisticated NLP strategies such as parsing and measuring grammatical relationships -- can open a window into political discourse that will make what happens in Congress more transparent to researchers and everyday citizens alike. 

The Congress Viewer is a prototype app. For our final app, citizens using our toolset will be able to easily navigate from an overview showing change over time, to a dramatization of how different candidates talk about the same issue, to the in-text mentions of word use that a computer has used to produce the visualizations in question.
