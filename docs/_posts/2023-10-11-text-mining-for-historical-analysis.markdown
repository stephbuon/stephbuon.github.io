title:  'Text Mining for Historical Analysis'
description: Text Mining for Historical Analysis offers a critical intervention into the evolving field of digital history. It introduces "computational historical thinking"-a hybrid methodology that integrates historical inquiry with computational methods. In doing so, this book explores the epistemological entanglements between computation, theory, and historical analysis, emphasizing how computational procedures actively shape the questions we ask and the meanings we derive. Through sustained engagement with historical corpora—such as the 19th-century Hansard debates and contemporary U.S. Congressional Records—this book demonstrates how textual data can be processed in ways that attend to both structure and semantics reimagining the relationship between computation and historical knowledge in the digital age.

This book manuscript introduces text mining for historical analysis using the R programming language. The exercises in this book are based on code for Jo Guldi’s _The Dangerous Art of Text Mining_ (2022) that have been rewritten with the purpose of offering an practical point of entry into the practice of digital history for those with no previous acquaintance with the basic methods of programming.

The intended readership of _Text Mining for Historical Analysis_ are historians, analysts, scholars, or students interested in learning about the methods used in digital history. Many of the coding exercises include material and explanation geared towards those who have never programmed before, or who have some programming experience but are new to R and its historical application. The first two chapters offer guided approaches to the programming concepts that are built on throughout this book.

The examples in this book are mostly drawn around one dataset, commonly known as "Hansard," which contains the official record of the debates of Britain's House of Lords and House of Commons, 1806-1899. It is a highly interesting data set because these transcripts cover the transformations of the Industrial Revolution, the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade by the British navy, the struggle for women's rights, and many other debates of general interest to readers of modern history.
