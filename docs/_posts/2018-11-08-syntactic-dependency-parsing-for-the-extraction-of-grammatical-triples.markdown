title:  Syntactic Dependency Parsing for the Extraction of Grammatical Triples
description: Grammatical triples extraction, that is, the extraction of grammatical subjects and their predicates from a sentence, has been used to track the development of anti-vaccination narratives on "Mommy Blogs," and to make claims about how online discourses about the environment have changed over time. One reason grammatical triples extraction has such wide-reaching usefulness to understanding some of the most relevant problems of our time is because it can distill large amounts of natural language text into its subject-object relations, thus revealing an underlying language of action defining the relationship between "self" and "other." Existing methods, however, have low precision and recall scores. For this reason I developed a method of triples extraction designed on historical and contemporary texts.
