title:  Syntactic Dependency Parsing for the Extraction of Grammatical Triples
description: Triples extraction has been used for textual analyses from discourse on climate change to anti-vaccination narratives. One reason triples extraction has such wide reaching applicability is because it can be insightful to any topic where subject-object relations are important for understanding a corpus. Existing methods, however, have low precision and recall scores. For this reason I developed a method of triples extraction designed on historical and contemporary texts. This method significantly outperforms linguistic accuracy of existing methods including Stanfordâ€™s OpenIE.
