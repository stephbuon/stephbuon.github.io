description: Transcripts of notarial records from the Fondo Escribanías in the National Archive of Cuba, an endangered repository. The transcripts document pawnship and selling practices involving enslaved people in Havana, Cuba during the 17th and 18th centuries. These records are important for analyzing how the enslaved person functioned as a “social connector,” linking a wide range of creditors and debtors, buyers and sellers, through contracts in the colonial urban economy.
