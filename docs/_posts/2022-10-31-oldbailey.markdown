title:  'oldbailey: R Library for Accessing Historical Old Bailey Trial Data'
description: oldbailey fetches historical trial data from the Old Bailey API (April 13, 1674 - April 1, 1913). It parses and resolves ambiguous and inconsistent XML while adding valuable metadata, such as the name of the first-person speaker. It returns an analysis-ready data frame with fields including speaker name, victim name, defendant name, their genders, crime location and date, and more!
