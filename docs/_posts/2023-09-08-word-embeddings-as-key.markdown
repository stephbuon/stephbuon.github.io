title:  Word Embeddings as a Key to the Study of Bias, Race, and Gender in Congress, 1880-2010
description: Word embeddings reveal how Congressional language around bias, race, and gender shifted from 1880 to 2010. From 1880 to 1970, “bias” was linked to personal emotion and partisanship; after 1975, it became associated with systemic issues like racism, sexism, and gerrymandering. Vector subtraction techniques show that early references to women emphasized suffrage and labor, while post-1970 discourse focused on reproduction and sexuality, with terms like “unwed,” “contraceptives,” and “clinics.” These changes reflect a broader shift toward identity-based and structural understandings of inequality in political speech.
