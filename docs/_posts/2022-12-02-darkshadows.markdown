title: 'Dark Shadows'
description: Dark Shadows is a film-noir style detective thriller designed for research. It serves as the test bed for proof-of-concept and prototyped system components, frameworks, and models that contribute to research on generative AI or machine learning. Central to its gameplay are conversational scenarios during which the player can use natural language to advance the game narrative. Dark Shadows features PANGeA's novel validation system, which uses self-prompting to evoke a large language model's (LLM) intellegence to evaluate and respond to user input. Dark Shadows exists across Unity and custom GPT versions. It uses generative AI for narrative and artwork to provide players with engaging gameplay.

Dark Shadows: Address the real-world problem of human trafficking while playing a video game. 

by Steph Buongiorno, Jake Klinkert, Tanishq Chawla, Zixin Zhaung, and Corey Clark at Southern Methodist University's Guildhall (video game) and Computer Science departments. 

Iterations:

I conceived of Dark Shadows as a film noir-style “document thriller” (inspired by Papers, Please! and Night Call). I designed and developed underlying “human-in-the-loop” mechanics to collect player feedback and train a machine learning model, which can disambiguate speakers, locations, and events in real human trafficking data. I guided graduate students on the design of the gameplay mechanics and narrative. https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/i-team-video-game-helps-researchers-fight-sex-trafficking/
Dark Shadows, Scene II

I designed NPCs that leverage large language models (LLMs) and a self-reflection-based validation system to enable dynamic, free-form interactions with the player aligned with a procedural game narrative (re: PANGeA). NPCs express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their responses, while the validation system ensures responses stay on narrative track. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys7vTkUZ8ic
Dark Shadows, Scene III

[Forthcoming] Dark Shadows will include a social engineering scene, where the player must investigate the NPCs’ personalities and use rhetorical devices to gain clues on the mystery.
