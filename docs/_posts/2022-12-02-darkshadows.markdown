title: 'Dark Shadows'
description: Dark Shadows is a film-noir style detective thriller designed for research. It serves as the test bed for proof-of-concept and prototyped system components, frameworks, and models that contribute to research on generative AI or machine learning. Central to its gameplay are conversational scenarios during which the player can use natural language to advance the game narrative. Dark Shadows features PANGeA's novel validation system, which uses self-prompting to evoke a large language model's (LLM) intellegence to evaluate and respond to user input. Dark Shadows exists across Unity and custom GPT versions. It uses generative AI for narrative and artwork to provide players with engaging gameplay.

As the teaching fellow for Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics (2022-2023) at the Santa Fe Institute, I design and teach workshops for participant researchers. I foster an inclusive and intellectually rigorous classroom for researchers with diverse backgrounds, from senior faculty to early career graduate students.
