As the teaching fellow for Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics (2022-2023) at the Santa Fe Institute, I design and teach workshops for participant researchers. I foster an inclusive and intellectually rigorous classroom for researchers with diverse backgrounds, from senior faculty to early career graduate students.

These courses are supported by National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH) Grant (no. HT-272418-20)
