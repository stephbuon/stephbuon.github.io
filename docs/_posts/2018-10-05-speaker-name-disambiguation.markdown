Analysis of speakers has been used to track emergence of modern party discipline and to make claims about speaker influence. But the accuracy of these analyses could be thwarted by messy data. Speaker names are often riddled with OCR errors. In other cases, speakers may be called by different permutations of their names or by their (rotating) office titles. Our research suggests that existing data sets can only disambiguate ~5-6% of the speaker names in the Hansard debates. At nearly 90% disambiguation, our disambiguation pipeline and data set makes substantial improvements for research analyzing speakers.
