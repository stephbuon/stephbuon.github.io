The Congressional Data Scraper (CDS) scrapes the plain text version of the Daily Editions of the U.S. Congressional Records from "congress.gov" that contain a search term. It outputs a data set with columns for: url, date, title (of record), speaker, and text. 

Everyone should have the means to collect an analysis-ready version of the Congressional Records! This tool makes it easy. If you have never used Python before, watch our 3 minute video (below) and by the end you will be collecting data.

Visit the <a href="https://github.com/stephbuon/congressional-data-scraper" style="color: blue"> Congressional Data Scraper repository</a> for additional installation and useage instructions and to get a copy for your own use.
