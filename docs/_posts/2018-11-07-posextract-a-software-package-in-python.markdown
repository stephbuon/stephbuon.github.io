posextract is a software package for extracting grammatical triples. See [Syntactic Dependency Parsing for the Extraction of Grammatical Triples](https://stephbuon.github.io/syntactic-dependency-relationships-and-the-extraction-of-grammatical-triples) for descriptions on how extracted triples have been used in research and why triples analysis might open dimensions of analysis for your own area of study! 

posextact has been designed to meet the increasing need for high-accuracy triples outputs for the analysis of text. We propose a solution aimed at reducing errors related to: a) ungrammatical extractions; b) double counting; and c) the missed detection of triples.

For usage instructions or to get a copy, see our [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/stephbuon/posextract). Or, install [posextract from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/posextract/) via `pip install posextract`.
