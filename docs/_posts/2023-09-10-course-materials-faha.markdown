As the teaching fellow for Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics (2022-2023) at the Santa Fe Institute, I design and teach workshops for participant researchers. I foster an inclusive and intellectually rigorous classroom for researchers with diverse backgrounds, from senior faculty to early career graduate students.
