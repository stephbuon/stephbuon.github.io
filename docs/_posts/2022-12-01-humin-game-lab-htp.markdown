title:  'The Human Tafficking Project'
description: This project addresses a human rights issue in conversation with academic researchers from four departments (Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, and Applied Science), Congress, and the Department of Justice. We use crowd sourcing and human-in-the-loop machine learning techniques to train a neural network and imporve predictive named entity recognition and social network analysis. This work is supported by Congress Bill (H.R. 2471).

This project addresses a human rights issue in conversation with academic researchers from four departments at Southern Methodist University (Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, and Guildhall video game development), Congress, and the Department of Justice. 

I serve as the technical lead for the development of a human-in-the-loop machine learning system that trains a neural network to improve predictive named entity recognition. 

Our human-in-the-loop system comes in the form of a dective-thriller video game. By using crowd-sourcing and citizen science, players solve entertaining mysteries while also identifying fine-grained entities such as the names of bars, restaurants, streets, and more. 

This work is supported by Congress Bill (H.R. 2471).
