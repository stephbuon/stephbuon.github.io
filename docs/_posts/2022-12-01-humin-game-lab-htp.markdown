title:  'The Human Tafficking Project'
description: This project addresses a human rights issue in conversation with academic researchers from four departments (Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, and Applied Science), Congress, and the Department of Justice. We use crowd sourcing and human-in-the-loop machine learning techniques to train a neural network and imporve predictive named entity recognition and social network analysis. This work is supported by Congress Bill (H.R. 2471).
