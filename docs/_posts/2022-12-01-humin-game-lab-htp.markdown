title:  'The Human Tafficking Project'
description: This project addresses a human rights issue in conversation with academic researchers from four departments (Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, and Applied Science), Congress, and the Department of Justice. We use crowd sourcing and human-in-the-loop machine learning techniques to train a neural network and imporve predictive named entity recognition and social network analysis. This work is supported by Congress Bill H.R. 2471.

This project addresses the human rights issue of modern slavery in conversation with academic researchers from four departments at Southern Methodist University (Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, and Guildhall video game development), Congress, the Department of Justice, and not-for-profit stakeholders.

I serve as the technical lead for the development of a human-in-the-loop machine learning system that leverages human computation gaming. While playing our fictional video game, people train a neural network and improve predictive named entity recognition. 

This work is supported by Congress Bill H.R. 2471.
