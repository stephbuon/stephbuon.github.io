title:  'Course Materials: Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics'
description: Computational methods enable scholars to systematically analyze and interpret large volumes of social, political, and cultural data, uncovering underlying patterns and insights within data at scale. The "Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics" (FAHA) course at the Santa Fe Institute is a comprehensive program designed to equip humanities scholars with computational and quantitative tools for their research. These materials are used for a course that aims to foster a supportive community, build practical skills, and diversify the field of humanities analytics by welcoming participants from various backgrounds and stages of their academic careers.

As the teaching fellow for Foundations and Applications of Humanities Analytics (2022-2023) at the Santa Fe Institute, I design and teach workshops for participant researchers. I foster an inclusive and intellectually rigorous classroom for researchers with diverse backgrounds, from senior faculty to early career graduate students.
