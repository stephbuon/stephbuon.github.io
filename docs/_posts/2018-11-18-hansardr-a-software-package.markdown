hansardr makes it easy to access the parsed debates from _The Hansard 19th-Century British Parliamentary Debates with Improved Speaker Names_ within the R environment.

This is a clean corpus of the 19th-century British Parliamentary Debates (1803-1909), also known as Hansard. It identifies debates whose records are missing from UK Parliamentâ€™s corpus, and it also offers a field for disambiguated speakers. We believe these improvements will enable researchers to analyze the Hansard debates, including speaker discourse, in a way that has not been accessible before.
