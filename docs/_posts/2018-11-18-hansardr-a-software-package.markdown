`hansardr` is any easy way to access the _SMU 19th-Century Hansard Corpus with Improved Speaker Names_ within the R environment. The _SMU 19th-Century Hansard Corpus with Improved Speaker Names_ is an analysis-ready corpus of the 19th-century British Parliamentary Debates (1803-1909), also known as Hansard. The corpus identifies debates whose records are missing from UK Parliamentâ€™s corpus, and it also offers a field for disambiguated speakers. We believe these improvements will enhance scholarship in digital history, enabling researchers to analyze the Hansard debates, including speaker discourse, in a way that has not been accessible before. 

The `hansardr` package offers the full corpus, debate metadata, and file metadata. See the [`hansardr` GitHub repository](https://github.com/stephbuon/hansardr) for installation instructions.

For supplementary materials meant to support the analysis of the Hansard debates, including tokens and their raw counts, bigrams and their raw counts, special vocabulary, speaker metadata, and topics from LDA topic modeling, see our complete data set, the [_SMU 19th-Century Hansard Corpus with Improved Speaker Names_](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZCYJH8), on the Harvard Dataverse.
