  <summary><strong>New Critical AI Studies in the Digital Humanities</strong></summary>

  <div style="overflow: auto;">
    

    <p>Text is everywhere around us. It is embedded in government and corporate reports. Text fills the pages of newspapers, shapes emails, and makes up the content of blog entries. Text is not only a product of human communication and expression, but is also increasingly generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Certainly, computational techniques for engaging text serve researchers well in our increasingly text producing world.</p>

    <p>This course explores how we create meaning from textual data, situating course themes within the evolving fields of critical AI studies and the digital humanities. In doing so, it combines two mechanisms into a method of critical inquiry: (a) the use of generative AI for text analysis and (b) the representation of text data as knowledge graphs that capture relationships between concepts, cultural context, and relevant metadata.</p>

    <p>Why are these mechanisms important? AI offers new opportunities for the computational analysis of text. Today, researchers can simply prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate narrative summaries or the code needed for an analysis. However, this process is not clearly explainable, and researchers risk generating responses that lack critical insight into the underlying data. Knowledge graphs, on the other hand, have long provided a means to store and represent nuanced information. Paired with LLMs, they add explainability to generative responses by linking them to a representation of the original data. This approach not only allows researchers to trace generative responses back to their sources, but can also be used to enrich generative responses with the nuanced context of a knowledge graph.</p>

    <p>When both mechanisms are within a researcherâ€™s grasp (LLMs and knowledge graphs), AI offers a new, critical process through which we can produce knowledge.</p>
