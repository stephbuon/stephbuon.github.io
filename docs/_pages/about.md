I am a doctoral candidate in the Applied Science department at Southern Methodist University's Lyle School of Engineering. I build data sets and computational tools for data analytics in the humanities and across the information and social sciences.

I believe that software engineering is most exciting when we are solving 100 problems at once, breaking down silos, and maximizing our impact on academic research and the world.
