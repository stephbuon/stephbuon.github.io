    <small><i>I co-direct a 10-person lab while playing a hands-on role in designing intelligent agents and hierarchical, multi-agent systems that autonomously learn new subjects (by parsing plain-language text into knowledge graphs), retrieve information that encodes domain knowledge, and self-validate (using techniques based on self-reflection/self-prompting).</i></small>

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p><small><i>In my profession it is expected to include co-authors who do not contribute writing. As corresponding author I performed all writing. I directed the student co-authors following my name in conceptualization, design, and development of their respective artifacts (e.g. a video game mechanic, artwork, story narrative) while enabling their own creative agency in our shared project. In this respect, co-authorship is used here to convey transparency and signal their contributions to dimensions of a larger project. When acting as 2nd+ author, I offered an intellectual contribution and produced writing.</i></small></p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>

<h4>Dark Shadows</h4>

<p>Steph Buongiorno, Jake Klinkert, Tanishq Chawla, Zixin Zhaung, and Corey Clark. Dark Shadows, Southern Methodist University, Guildhall. 
<small><i>Descripton: Address the real-world problem of human trafficking while playing a video game.</i></small></p> 

<h4>Dark Shadows, Scene I</h4>

<p>I conceived of Dark Shadows as a film noir-style “document thriller” (inspired by Papers, Please! and Night Call). I designed and developed underlying “human-in-the-loop” mechanics to collect player feedback and train a machine learning model, which can disambiguate speakers, locations, and events in real human trafficking data. I guided graduate students on the design of the gameplay mechanics and narrative. https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/i-team-video-game-helps-researchers-fight-sex-trafficking/</p>

<h4>Dark Shadows, Scene II</h4>

<p>I designed NPCs that leverage large language models (LLMs) and a self-reflection-based validation system to enable dynamic, free-form interactions with the player aligned with a procedural game narrative (re: PANGeA). NPCs express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their responses, while the validation system ensures responses stay on narrative track. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys7vTkUZ8ic</p>

<h4>Dark Shadows, Scene III</h4> 
[Forthcoming] Dark Shadows will include a social engineering scene, where the player must investigate the NPCs’ personalities and use rhetorical devices to gain clues on the mystery.

<h1>Grant Proposals</h1>

<p>“Integrating Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Game Design, and Educational Assessment in a STEM+C Curriculum.” Topic: To support the development of personalized, educational agents in Minecraft. We propose the integration of an advanced set of agent abilities across three design types: A) Personalized Educational Agents that autonomously monitor student progression and dynamically generate customized curriculum for addressing individuals' needs based on their existing knowledge, personalities, and interests; B) Bridging Agents that demonstrate the “bigger picture” behind computational thinking by creating connections between STEM topics and interdisciplinary topics, such as the Language Arts; and C) Analyst Agents that translate student progression and learning outcomes to teachers for their easy assessment of student progress.</p>

<p>“Gen-AI Distributed Autonomous Agents and Deployment Infrastructure to Accelerate Research, Discovery and Development.” Topic: To support finishing the development and design of intelligent agents and hierarchical, multi-agent systems for deployment in a distributed environment. To be applied to research problems with collaborators in psychology, chemistry, education, and economics.</p> 

<p>“SmartCADD Machine Learning Drug Discovery.” Topic: To support the development of AI for discovering new medical drug compounds. </p>
