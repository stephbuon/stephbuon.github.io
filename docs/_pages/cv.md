    Postdoctoral Fellow and Lab Co-Director, Guildhall Video Game Department, Southern Methodist University.<br>
    <small><i>I co-direct a 10-person lab while playing a hands-on role in designing intelligent agents and hierarchical, multi-agent systems that autonomously learn new subjects (by parsing plain-language text into knowledge graphs), retrieve information that encodes domain knowledge, and self-validate (using techniques based on self-reflection/self-prompting).</i></small>

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p><small><i>In my profession it is expected to include co-authors who do not contribute writing. As corresponding author I performed all writing. I directed the student co-authors following my name in conceptualization, design, and development of their respective artifacts (e.g. a video game mechanic, artwork, story narrative) while enabling their own creative agency in our shared project. In this respect, co-authorship is used here to convey transparency and signal their contributions to dimensions of a larger project. When acting as 2nd+ author, I offered an intellectual contribution and produced writing.</i></small></p>
