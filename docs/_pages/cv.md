<h3>Articles</h3>

<p><small><i>In my profession it is expected to include co-authors who do not contribute writing. As corresponding author I performed all experimental research design, evaluation, and writing. I directed the student co-authors following my name in conceptualization, design, and development of their respective artifacts (e.g. a video game mechanic, artwork, story narrative) while enabling their own creative agency in our shared project. In this respect, co-authorship is used here to convey transparency and signal their contributions to dimensions of a larger project. When acting as 2nd+ author, I offered an intellectual contribution and produced writing.</i></small></p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>

<p>Steph Buongiorno, Jake Klinkert, Zixin Zhaung, Tanishq Chawla, and Corey Clark. <i>Dark Shadows</i>, Southern Methodist University, Guildhall.<br>
<small><i>Counter the real-world problem of human trafficking while playing a video game. <br> 
I conceived of <i>Dark Shadows</i> as a film noir-style "document thriller" (inspired by <i>Papers, Please!</i> and <i>Night Call</i>). Prior to the advent of generative AI, I designed and developed human-in-the-loop mechanics to gather player feedback and train a machine learning model capable of disambiguating speakers, locations, and events in real human trafficking data. Now, <i>Dark Shadows</i> pushes the boundaries of generative AI in video games through a novel validation system that enables dynamic, free-form interactions with the player aligned with a procedural game narrative (re: PANGeA). The validation system uses self-reflection to evaluate the text input and generate a response in alignment with expected rules. To enrich players’ experiences, NPCs express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their responses.</i></small></p>

<ul>
    <small><li>See how <i>Dark Shadows</i> fights human trafficking on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/i-team-video-game-helps-researchers-fight-sex-trafficking/">CBS News</a>.</li></small>
    <small><li>See <i>Dark Shadows</i> gameplay on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys7vTkUZ8ic">YouTube</a>.</li></small>
</ul>

<p><small><i>Future Work: Dark Shadows will include a social engineering scene, where the player must investigate the NPCs’ personalities and use rhetorical devices to gain clues on the mystery.</i></small></p>

<h1>Grant Proposals</h1>

<p>"Inclusive Game-Based Learning with AI Agents: Personalizing Computational Thinking Instruction for Students with Reading Disabilities" Topic: To support the development of personalized, educational agents in Minecraft. We propose the integration of an advanced set of agent abilities across three design types: A) Personalized Educational Agents that autonomously monitor student progression and dynamically generate customized curriculum for addressing individuals' needs based on their existing knowledge, personalities, and interests; B) Bridging Agents that demonstrate the "bigger picture" behind computational thinking by creating connections between STEM topics and interdisciplinary topics, such as the Language Arts; and C) Analyst Agents that translate student progression and learning outcomes to teachers for their easy assessment of student progress.</p>

<p> "Developing Autonomous Agents to Improve Information Flow on Human trafficking" Topic: To make the response to human trafficking more resilient, we propose a new, complex data ecosystem of open knowledge networks along with information retrieval technology that improves data accessibility. Our research will focus on the state of Texas and confront the problems surrounding the development and use of a distributed, open knowledge network that holds sensitive information that cannot be shared directly. Our aim is to improve information flow between stakeholders (e.g. law enforcement, DHS, travel intermediaries) through a scalable architecture while enabling users to both ingest and retrieve meaningful knowledge artifacts. Key to our research is a novel agent layer that advances the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics (PPDSA) technology by serving the dual purpose of: a. ensuring privacy protection and compliance with data sharing regulation; and b. maintaining integrity by preventing unauthorized data injections and data leaks. In addition, agents will be able to interface directly with the network, making private and secure connections between entities. </p>

<p>"Gen-AI Distributed Autonomous Agents and Deployment Infrastructure to Accelerate Research, Discovery and Development." Topic: To support finishing the development and design of intelligent agents and hierarchical, multi-agent systems for deployment in a distributed environment. To be applied to research problems with collaborators in psychology, chemistry, education, and economics.</p>
