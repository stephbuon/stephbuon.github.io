I am a doctoral candidate in the applied science department at Southern Methodist Universityâ€™s Lyle School of Engineering. I develop methods and tools that support the robust, sensitive, and accurate analysis of language. 

I have 5 years experience collecting, processing, and modeling large amounts of policy and geospatial data (up to ~150 GB) using Python, R, SQL, and Shell; I have 3 years of leadership experience working on multidisciplinary research teams (domestic and international), giving talks to technical and non-technical audiences, and directing student work; and I have 7 years of experience writing analytical and creative research papers on historical and policy data.
